# LLM Introduction

## What is LLM in simple term.
### Understands Intent â€“ 
  - in simple language , LLM extract Intent and param value from prompt/text and response based on knowledge in human language other than just field and value. for example - user says,
    -   I need to book a flight from New York to London on March 10.
    -   Schedule a sales report for last quarter and email it to John.
  - It figures out what the user wants from the text (e.g., "Book a flight" or "Generate a report").
  - Extracts Parameters (Entities) â€“ It pulls out key details from the text (e.g., "New York to London," "March 10," or "Sales Report for Q1").
  - Generates a Response â€“ It replies in natural human language, using its stored knowledge and understanding of context.
  - Unlike a traditional system that just maps fields to values, an LLM can infer meaning, handle complex queries, and respond intelligently based on its training data.
  - For example:
    - User Input: "Schedule a sales report for last quarter and email it to John."
    - LLM Interpretation:
      - Intent: Generate & Send Report
      - Parameters:
        - Report Type: Sales
        - Timeframe: Last Quarter
        - Recipient: John
      - Response: "Your sales report for the last quarter has been scheduled and will be emailed to John."
    #### This makes it more dynamic than a simple form-based input system. ðŸš€
