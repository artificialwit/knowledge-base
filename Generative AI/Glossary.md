## Crunchinh
Processing of large datasets and complex computations needed to train, fine-tune, or infer results using machine learning models. Here are some key examples:
### Data Crunching
Cleaning, processing, and analyzing massive datasets before feeding them into an AI model.
  - Example: Parsing millions of records to extract patterns for an AI-driven analytics system.
### Model Training Crunching
Performing high-intensity calculations on GPUs/TPUs to train deep learning models.
  - Example: Training an LLM like GPT or a vision model requires crunching terabytes of data.
### Inference Crunching
Running computations on a trained AI model to generate predictions in real-time.
- Example: A chatbot analyzing user queries and generating intelligent responses.
### Decision-Making Crunching
AI agents evaluating multiple factors before making decisions.
- Example: Your AI agent processing workflows, API calls, and business rules to determine the next action.
