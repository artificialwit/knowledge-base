  - after insatllation search in windows as PgAdmin to run the Postgre Console, it is just like SQL Server managament Studio
  - We have command from also for PostgreSQL, that is SQL Shell (pgsql)
  - defaults
    - default connection/server is localhost,
    - default database created is postgres
    - default user of that database is postgres
    - default password would be same as we entered on installation time
    - Default schema is public just like dbo in MS SQL. all table, procedure etc. must be a part of a schema, just like MS SQL
      
### Language
  - **just PL/SQL, in postgre it calls PL/pgSQL**. It allows users to write functions, triggers, and procedural code within the database using control structures like loops, conditions, and error handling
  - **PL/Python â€“ Allows writing functions in Python.**
### Common Command
  - SELECT datname FROM pg_database
  - SERIAL data type for Auto increment
  - currval('index_name_of_table')
  - nextval('index_name_of_table') , it store in table as default formula to get the next auto number in case of insert
  - LIMIT 5 , to get top 5 rows from select command, it must be last command
  - Use CONCAT(firstName, LastName) , to concatinate two string, it is better way
  - Use CONCAT_WS(' ', firstName, LastName) , to concatinate two string with seperator, it is better way
